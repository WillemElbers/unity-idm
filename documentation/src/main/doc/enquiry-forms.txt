== Enquiry forms

Enquiry forms are a close relative of registration forms, with one principal difference: enquires are targeted 
at existing users. 

Enquiry can be defined to collect additional information from existing users. This information can be anything 
ranging from acceptance of new terms of use to collection of user's additional attribute which become necessary. 

Enquiry forms are created in a nearly the same way as registration forms. The differences are:

. Enquiry can be filled on a standalone URL (similar to standalone URL of registration form, but requires 
authentication) or the user is asked to fill the enquiry after log in to Unity.
. Enquiry is targeted to a group - all members of a group are asked to fill an enquiry.
. Information on filled enquiry (as well as ignored permanently in case of optional enquires) is recorded in 
user's attributes.
. Enquiry form does not work with the invitations subsystem (enquires are filled after authentication so this is 
typically not needed, but we may remove this limitation in future).
. Enquiry can contain only manually entered information, it can not be associated with remote login pipeline
as registration forms (what obviously doesn't make any sense). 

The remaining features are post submission translation profile, redirects, automation of processing etc. is the same
as in case of registration forms.
